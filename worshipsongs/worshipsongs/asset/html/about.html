        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
        This app brings you most of the Praise and Worship lyrics used by Tamil churches all over the world. Now, you can worship anytime, anywhere with all the lyrics you need.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Why Worship Songs?</h3>
        
        <p>
        Why develop another app when there are tons of similar apps?
        Worship Songs was developed as we couldn't find an app with latest Praise and Worship songs with both Tamil and Romanised text.
        So, Worship Songs is the world's first mobile app that offers Romanised text for Tamil lyrics.
        Many Tamil congregations also sing English songs. Worship Songs provides many popular English songs as well so you need not look for another app.
        And finally, the songs database evolves rapidly. New songs are added often, so you will never miss your favourite song.
        Did we mention that Worship Songs is open source? Yes, you can be a part of this project. Isn't that great?

        <h4>Q. I couldn't find a song that I am looking for. What should I do?</h4>
        <p>
        Refine your search terms. For example, instead of "Arathanai", try searching for "Aarathanai". Worship Songs names the song titles that matches closely with their Tamil counterparts.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Q. I want to request a new feature. How do I go about that?
        </h4>
        <p>
        The songs database and the app are maintained in separate Github projects. This is because the songs database is shared by both the iOS and Android version of Worship Songs. Worship Songs for iOS lives at https://github.com/crunchersaspire/worshipsongs-ios. You can request for a new feature by creating an issue there.

        <h4>
            Q. Is there a way I can use these songs in my Church?
        </h4>
        <p>
        Absolutely. In fact, the songs database that is shipped with this app is used by <a href="http://tmcsubangjaya.com"> Tamil Methodist Church Subang Jaya</a>.
        If you want to do that in your Church, you would need to install a software named OpenLP and replace it's default songs database with the one that ships with this app.
